Errors are removed an redisplayed after every task error. This works for Sass, React, or anything that emits an error with a line number.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some of the features including scrolling to the line where the error occurred and showing an icon on the line the error occurred. Currently only Sublime Text 3 is supported.\n</p>\n",
