# My website

v2 of my website, built with Nuxt.js. Cool, init? Still a work in progress.

## Todo

- Replace all colors with variables
- Add these to package.json and modify webpack to handle css plugins

- Maybe add js to fullscreen an image
- Use this for when switching between posts

  transform: scale(0.7) translateY(50px);
  transform-origin: 50% top;
  transition: transform 400ms;

- Edit some of the articles errors like in medium image loading and favorite features of es2015
- Add disqus back to articles
