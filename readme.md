# My website

v2 of my website, built with Nuxt.js. Cool, init? Still a work in progress.

## Todo

- Refactor component filename to be AppSiteHeader instead of just SiteHeader
- add these to package.json and modify webpack to handle css plugins

```
"sass-lint": "1.12.1",
"fastclick": "1.0.6",
"cssnano": "3.10.0",
"autoprefixer": "8.1.0",
```

- Maybe add js to fullscreen an image
- Use this for when switching between posts

  transform: scale(0.7) translateY(50px);
  transform-origin: 50% top;
  transition: transform 400ms;

- Change colors to variables
- Edit some of the articles errors like in medium image loading and favorite features of es2015
- Add codepen js to article pages
- Add disqus back to articles
- Add next and previous article ID to post json data
