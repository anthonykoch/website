# My website

v2 of my website, built with Nuxt.js. Cool, init? Still a work in progress.

## Todo

- Refactor sass styles
- add these to package.json and modify webpack to handle css plugins
```
    "sass-lint": "1.12.1",
    "fastclick": "1.0.6",
    "cssnano": "3.10.0",
    "autoprefixer": "8.1.0",
```



- Maybe add js to fullscreen an image
